# Fractal Explorations

This repository showcases the beauty and complexity of fractals through computational visualizations. Fractals are not only a fascinating mathematical concept that are relevant to physics but also a personal hobby of mine:

- **Burning Ship Fractal**: A fractal with sharp, ship-like structures that emerges from iterative mapping.
- **Julia Set**: A family of fractals related to the Mandelbrot set.
- **Mandelbrot Set**: A famous fractal defined by the behavior of a simple quadratic map. My implementation computes the Lyapunov exponents of the Mandelbrot set.

Exploring fractals interests my passion for mathematics, art, and computational science.
